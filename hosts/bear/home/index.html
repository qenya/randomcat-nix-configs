		<h1>Unspecified Systems</h1>

		Hello! Welcome to unspecified.systems.

		<h2>Administrator</h2>

		I am Janet Cobb, also known as Random Internet Cat or randomnetcat.

		My personal website is <a href="https://randomcat.org">randomcat.org</a>, though
		there isn't much there at the moment (unless I've since put something there and
		forgotten to update this).

		<h2>Server</h2>

		This is running on a VPS using NixOS. This machine is called
		<code>bear</code>, and the configuration is available in <a
		href="https://github.com/randomnetcat/nix-configs">a GitHub repo</a>.

		Currently, this server isn't used for much. The hope is that it will
		eventually be able to run my personal email.
